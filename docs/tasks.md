# E-Commerce Frontend Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks to improve the codebase architecture, performance, maintainability, and user experience.

## Architecture and Structure

1. [ ] Implement a proper state management solution (Redux Toolkit or Zustand) for managing global application state
2. [ ] Create a proper API layer with service classes for data fetching instead of importing JSON files directly
3. [ ] Reorganize component folder structure to follow a more consistent pattern (features, shared, layouts)
4. [ ] Remove unused App.jsx file or repurpose it as the main application component
5. [ ] Implement proper TypeScript integration for better type safety and developer experience
6. [ ] Create environment configuration for different deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Components and Code Quality

7. [ ] Replace anchor tags with React Router's Link components for client-side navigation
8. [ ] Implement proper form validation for search and other input fields
9. [ ] Extract reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards) into a component library
10. [ ] Add prop-types or TypeScript interfaces for all components
11. [ ] Implement error boundaries to gracefully handle runtime errors
12. [ ] Refactor inline styles to use consistent Tailwind classes or CSS modules
13. [ ] Implement responsive design improvements for mobile and tablet views

## Performance Optimization

14. [ ] Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting
15. [ ] Add image optimization for product images (responsive sizes, WebP format)
16. [ ] Implement virtualization for long lists of products
17. [ ] Add proper loading states and skeleton screens for async operations
18. [ ] Implement memoization for expensive calculations and component renders

## Testing and Quality Assurance

19. [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
20. [ ] Create basic unit tests for critical components
21. [ ] Implement integration tests for key user flows
22. [ ] Set up end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
23. [ ] Implement automated accessibility testing

## User Experience and Features

24. [ ] Implement a proper cart functionality with local storage persistence
25. [ ] Add user authentication and profile management
26. [ ] Implement product filtering and sorting functionality
27. [ ] Add product detail page with related products
28. [ ] Implement wishlist functionality
29. [ ] Add product reviews and ratings
30. [ ] Implement checkout process with form validation

## DevOps and Deployment

31. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
32. [ ] Implement automated code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
33. [ ] Add bundle analysis to monitor bundle size
34. [ ] Implement proper error logging and monitoring
35. [ ] Set up performance monitoring and analytics

## Documentation

36. [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
37. [ ] Document component API and usage examples
38. [ ] Add inline code documentation for complex functions
39. [ ] Create architecture diagrams for better visualization of the system
40. [ ] Document state management patterns and data flow
